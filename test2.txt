I need your help in converting HTML content into a format suitable for a Word document, ensuring all information is preserved. Please manually interpret and convert HTML tags to mimic Word formatting. Specifically, transform headings (<h1> through <h6>) to their corresponding styles in Word, <p> tags to text paragraphs, <ul> and <ol> to bulleted and numbered lists, and styles like <strong> and <em> to bold and italic respectively. It's crucial that the entire content, including any embedded elements or attributes, is accurately represented and nothing is excluded.
